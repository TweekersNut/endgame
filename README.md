define('PUBLIC_ROOT',dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__)))."/public"); //Dynamic no need to change
define('URL_ROOT',"YOUR DOMAIN NAME");
define('SITE_NAME','YOUR SITE NAME');
define('USE_SSL',true); // True = use HTTPS || False = use HTTP

## Troubleshooting

If package works but its using ```/public/home/index``` then you can create a .htaccess file given below in the root dir and use it.
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^$ public/ [L]
